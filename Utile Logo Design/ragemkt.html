                 <p class="postText">
                The R.A.G.E has been open since 2010; this may or may not be relevant for a couple of reasons. Taking current trends into consideration that date might be useful as an indicator of the shops target audience. In general shops that specialize in “retro” apparel or products opened after a certain year ( ex. 2005 or 2006 according to this <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-rapacity-of-the-record-revival-8026756.html">article</a> ) has a target audience of people between the ages of 18 – 28 This is evident in this article on vinyl sales that has Urban Outfitters as the biggest vendor worldwide. It contains information about the age demographic that we could use to back up our estimates of the clients target audience based on the products they sell you can view them <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2014/09/25/urban-outfitters-is-now-the-number-one-seller-of-vinyl-in-the-world/"> Here</a>.
                <br><br>
                Another important point of information on the clients’ site is the description on the site of the genre of vinyl they sell. The sites describes the shops initial stock as “a handful of consoles, a slew of games and a couple hundred punk LPs and has evolved into Dublin’s largest collection of old school games and second hand vinyl”. Whilst this isn’t a literal stock appraisal, from anecdotal evidence and familiarity with the punk subculture we have deduced that second-hand punk LPs have a fairly niche audience. 
                 <br><br>
                This information is vital as a foundation for our design choices. Using the effectiveness of nostalgia as a marketing tool and it’s importance in social identity we intend to capitalize on the clients specialist products to maximize their reach.

            <h2 class="sectionHead">Client Profile</h2>
            <p class="postText">
                The R.A.G.E’s ethos is to provide rare and vintage video games and second-hand vinyl unavailable in regular music and game shops at a reasonable price.
                <br><br>
                The R.A.G.E separates itself from other game and music retailers by offering a specialist selection of rare and more obscure stock and providing knowledgeable staff whom also share a personal interest in the stock and can provide educated suggestions to customers.
<br><br>
                The R.A.G.E prides itself on the specialist atmosphere in store which provides a different unique experience to other retailers where the emphasis is on a commercial and corporate presentation.
<br><br>
                The previously mentioned specialist atmosphere gives the impression to the customer that the shop places an emphasis on the hobby rather than the commercial aspect which is often very attractive to the target demographic.

            <h2 class="sectionHead">Branding Decisions</h2>
            <p class='postText'>
                When it came to rebranding the R.A.G.E we marked-up three separate themes and design approaches that we felt would optimize the clients’ brand, ethos and industry. 
                <br><Br>
                The first of our branding concepts was based on a comic book art style. The concept behind this approach revolved around a relatively simple but recognizable font based logo. Our main aim when choosing the comic style logo was create a design which would be easily reproduced by hand as we found this to be an effective test of how well a logo would remain in the customers mind. The rationale behind choosing a comic style art direction is based on the use of similar stylistic traits in iconic video games such as Street Fighter (1987) (see figure 1). Based on the products stocked by the client and the target audience identified in the above section, this style of logo used in conjunction with the use of bright colors would be eye-catching and recognizable as a point of interest by potential customers.
<br><Br>
                The second branding concept we decided upon was based on a retro video game theme. Our main aim in applying this team to the clients brand was to evoke the nostalgia of the golden age of video games from the early 1980s to the mid 1990s. This is relevant to the client as it caters to their primary product. The main creative concept will involve the use of iconic video game imagery such as recognizable shapes and images from classic video game titles such as Super Mario Bros. (1985), Space Invaders (1978), Tetris (1984) and Pong (1972). The main reason for developing this style of logo is due to its strong relevance to the variety of services that the client offers. In addition to this similar to the first concept the use of video iconography would grab the attention of potential customers.
<br><Br>
                For our third branding idea we decided to focus on a brand logo rooted in simplicity and clarity to maximize upon the power of immediate brand recognition. In terms of relevancy to the client’s services as a large part of our research has been on 1980s and the initial entry of computer based fonts, we plan on making use of the decade’s iconic information design as a vehicle for our client’s brand. We plan to draw from the raster screens of early Home Computers and physical features from early Home Video Game Consoles. Through this concept we hope to emphasise the professionalism of the client and provide a modern interpretation of the brands focus on retro products.
