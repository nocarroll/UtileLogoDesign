                            Pixel fonts are iconic of the 1980s and early 1990s which are arguably considered the Golden Age of Home Consoles and Home or Personal Computers. For the first time since the invention of the printing press, typographers had to totally reconsider how fonts and typefaces would communicate information through this new medium; the screen. So the dot matrix and the pixel fonts were invented. Not only are they iconic of their time, but they have proved timeless and variations are still being created today.

                            And then we have Tenacity Condensed. If you recognise this font that’s because it’s very widely used in everything from video games to websites to print. It was developed in the 2000s when the need for a text that could be shrunk down very small but still communicate information clearly on the screens of mobile phones emerged. Spiekermann uses Tenacity in Stop Stealing Sheep… alongside Verdana, with sexy results.

                            We are so over exposed to sans-serif fonts that we believe nothing can be communicated in serif fonts as well as it can be done with the sans serif. Erik Speikermann really nails it when he says: 
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            “A real typeface needs rhythm, needs contrast, it comes from handwriting, and that's why I can read your handwriting, you can read mine. And I'm sure our handwriting is miles away from Helvetica or anything that would be considered legible, but we can read it, because there's a rhythm to it, there's a contrast to it. Helvetica hasn't got *any* of that.”
                        </blockquote>    
                            
                        <p class="postText">
                            But, content on webpages needs to be clear, so I propose a clean sans-serif for content (NOT HELVETICA OR ARIAL) and for headings, logos or points of interest should be described with a beautiful, well-considered, stand-out font.

                            In Type and Typography, Baines and Haslem say:
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>“The history of type is a history of technical constraints.”</blockquote>

                            This is an interesting quote in terms of how early computers made weird, imperfect typefaces which have no come to be iconic, much like our own human handwriting.

Eboy found that consistently using 36 × 36 pixel images significantly reduced the overall load-time. In no time at all they had developed a series of upper and lower bodies, text balloons and accessories – a building block set of Frankenstein proportions. It seemed a logical step to then make a font of the various components.<a name='script' id='script'></a>  The wish now is to share the FF PEECOL idea and hope that other designers will follow suit, creating new designs of standard size and raster that can be freely mixed and matched.”

                            Script fell out of favour after the World Wars. Hand drawn advertisements with elegant scripts were seen as twee and old-fashioned. Helvetica because more and more du jour and even in the 1990s, the backlash was “grunge” typography. Anarchic text pieces dominated magazine covers and album art. Finally, tastes came full circle and the disciplined Script fonts were back in. But the 21st century breathed new life into them as they became uniform through vectors.

                            It seems like Script is everywhere since its recent resurgence in popularity amongst the trendy, chalkboard painted bars and coffeeshops. Everyone want’s a Script Logo, it’s vintage yet modernised through computer software. There is no deny script fonts, especially handmade ones are beautiful. But they must be implemented responsibly.

                            The typography on arcade decals typically involves ‘active’ type. The titles are integrated in the scene and are seldom mere static labels bearing the name. Rather, these titles make up part of the action that the designers have lifted from the game. Pac-Man (1980) shows text that is leaping or moving at speed, while Space Invaders (1978) and Defender (1981), both space-themed games display a ‘crawling’ text that is reminiscent of the iconic Star Wars (1977) title text, itself lifted from the Flash Gordon serials (circa 1940).

                            Fonts used are mostly san-serif, often ‘block’ type. Most of the titles use no more than three colours, and many use shadow or block effects to make the text appear 3D. These trends were undoubtedly common at the time, but have aged quite badly in graphic design terms. Pong (1972) stands alone as the simplest and least-dated cabinet decal, employing a simple rounded sans-serif font in black over an off-yellow cabinet.

                            As a final note on text, some titles add decorative features to their title type to make it unique, as seen in the star in Donkey Kong and the flash in Galaga (1981). Though these have little to do with gameplay of in-game visuals, they certainly make the cabinet decals more interesting and suggest that the games offer dynamic and engaging user experiences, which would have been an important message to communicate in the frantic arcade era.

                            The characters and landscapes shown on the cabinets are often in a comic book style, as seen in Donkey Kong (1981), Dig Dug (1982) and Street Fighter (1987). We can exploit this in our design as it is an obvious link between two aspects of our client’s business, the comic and art service and the video game service.

                            The title screens are quite similar across the board and, retrospectively, have established themselves as a unique way of meaningfully displaying information. They make use of blank space very well, and though it was possible for most titles to flood their screens with colour; nearly all the title screens are predominantly black and use white to display statistical or instructional text and colour to represent elements of the game (characters and names) in a way that foreshadows the main game narrative nicely without imposing needless and bloated information about rules and gameplay strategies on the user. This shows consideration of information design.

                            The visual elements we can borrow from the title screens could include the ubiquitous pixel text for some element of the client website (the footer contact/navigation/about links perhaps), the wide spacing of information and the use of black, white and choice colours which would certainly cause a response of familiarity<a name="ingame"></a> in users of the site, most of whom will be familiar with the style of information display.

                            Much of the same visual tropes discussed above are true of the gameplay. Of course, the animation of characters and backgrounds is an additional feature of gameplay screens and one that could be explored in our client’s visual identity, but perhaps this could be at the sacrifice of clarity, sharpness and ease of navigation of the site, which overall would negatively affect the user experience.

                            The gameplay screens for raster display games such as Space Invaders and Donkey Kong feature high-contrast colours on black backgrounds. These screens are striking and iconic. The logo could echo these visual features as it needs to be recognisable in small display contexts such as Twitter avatars and letterheads (though the latter may never use colour).

                            The machines of the golden age of video games feature outdatedCRT screens, interesting angles of construction and almost ubiquitous plastic grills to allow the circuitry to cool during use. Plastic, wood and painted metal don’t offer rich visual materials to base new designs on but shape and angle are certainly salvageable as inspiration from arcade cabinets, Ataris, and Nintendo consoles.

                            One of the most iconic symbols of video games is the joystick, followed closely by arcade buttons. The simple and smooth roundness of these controls could be adapted into the border shapes of our client’s site or, additionally, could feature in the logo or as a platform of which to display the logo. The bright colours echo the in-game visuals as well as the comicesque cabinet art.

                            The website is packed full of character information and also by looking at their navigation bar you can clearly see how much content is on their website. Their navigation has 10 items on it.

This site was designed with some fun features but its lack of fluidity and responsiveness proved to be its downfall. Hoping to be too Retro the site has sacraficed a nice visual appeal to its audience. their posts are not uniform across their sizes which leads to a disjointed look on the website.

This is a part of the website that we would need to intergrate into our website due to the fact that the main aim of RAGE is to sell games. They stick to a very strict color scheme featuring their best selling products which leads you to a larger store.

                            After looking at the larger companies we looked closer to home. The sites we chose were LS Comics based in Parnell Street and Digit, a game design company based in South City Quay.

                           First up was LS Comics. This website was nice but took a long time to load due to the complexity of their background being made of interchangable images. The logo on this although eye catching is a bit over done. With color and light effects it does look nice but how would it look on a letter head in black and white? It would also be nice to see this logo on a business card.

                           The one very nice feature of this is the switchable background. Some of the images downbelow are also animated GIF's so it is possible to have an animated background. The site does not have a portfolio section on the site instead their portfolio is featured down the bottom with the ability to make each item their background.

                           One of the sites we found could be used to influence the design that we applied to the rage was Digit Gaming. This is a company based in dublin that design games. Their site uses a simple white background with their content placed above images and a fixed header, very much similar to our utile site. 
                           
                           <Br><br>
                           The nicest part of their site however is their header. The illustraton that makes the background image adds to the level of professionalism that is expected from game designers. They also have a very simple logo which fits perfectly both over the image background and on the navigation bar that appears as you scroll down the page. This is one of the reasons we tried to keep the logo simple for The R.A.G.E.

                        <p class='postText'>
                            Looking at current design trends that are being used in the retro gaming industry we can see a lot of them tend to use an old style website but without some really nice content and a nice design this is not going to be visually appealing to the audience that they are looking for. Retro Gamer is an example of this. The only really visually appealing part of their site was the logo.
                            <Br><br>
                            Marvel and DC websites are a step in the right direction. Marvel in particular have a design that would apply to our site, they show off their work and latest projects with a slider at the top, emphasize the projects that are currently being rolled out as you move down before bringing in the store with featured projects followed by their most popular projects.
                            <Br><br>
                            Although getting closer to the mark it’s still not quite what we are looking for if we head down the comic style for our site. Finally we come to lightening strike and digit gaming. Both use parallax and full-page backgrounds, Digit uses it more efficiently than LS Comics for the simple fact that their logo is not over the top. Using parallax animations as you scroll through the Digit website it is also easier to see content as their full page background gives way to a white textured background with dark writing. The high contrast means that we can easily see the content and read it. The large images for each section show us that we are in another section of the website. 
                            <Br><br>
                            If we are going to do a site for a retro gaming company then I believe that a mixture of all these different styles is going to be needed. With digit working as a main influence with the content layout of sites such as marvel and DC and avoiding site like retro gamer I believe we could produce a design for this company that would show off who they are, what they have to sell, open up their store to online customers through the use of a store catalogue and database and in designing their identity we can ensure that they will become a brand recognized throughout the retro gaming markets. Below are a number of sketch ideas based on comic style writings.

                            Black Flag font and bars. This is an extremely iconicand often parodied logo in the world of punk and would act as somewhat of a joke to the target audience.Ways which this could be used include replacing each bar with the arcade machine outline below.

                            Descendents font and “Milo” art style. It’s possible toincorporate two of our concepts at once using this idea.Like the previous logo this is extremely iconic and often parodied and would also prove recognizable to the target demographic. As the R.A.G.E also sell games as well as stock punk vinyl records one idea is to use the art style of the Milo character and do Mario/Donkey Kong or some other iconic game character in the same style as well as optionally including the video game concept by presenting this take on the character in an 8-bit color style.

                           Misfits Crimson Ghost logo. In terms of using thisexample as inspiration one option would be to put the Crimson Ghost character in an 8-bit art style and place it onto an arcade machine screen. Alternatively the original logos art style could be applied to a game character such as Donkey Kong.

                        Sonic Youth Goo album cover. Has appeal as it is an actual album cover and likely to be more applicable to the tastes of the clients target audience. Sonic Youth also has more sub-cultural relevance to the target demographic as it is more recent in relation to the estimated age of the market. In terms of design the image can either be presented in an 8-bit style oralternatively we could parody the cover and make use of its recognizably to create a bond with the target audience through humor as can be seen in the belowexamples:
