                           The Utile logo is a Lobster Two script font encapsulated neatly in a circle. There are three variations on the logo which are used in different media contexts and applications. The design of this logo was influenced by the lessons of Inge Druckrey. She would assign design exercises to her students where they had to make something interesting with a limited number of shapes such as two squares. We experimented in combinations of interesting typefaces with simple geometric shapes in keeping with our design ethos of making functional and useful media more beautiful. This restriction resulted in the final logo. The design company logo is balanced, near-symmetrical and recognisable in any size, from any perspective and even in a mirrored image. When the logo is allowed to mature and become internalised in the perceptions of a viewer or audience, Utile as a word can begin to lose linguistic meaning while the shape itself becomes an iconic image of the brand and design philosophy; clear, considered and elegant.

                            The logo font is Lobster Two, a script font that has solved some inherent problems that script fonts have by taking advantage of the open font format. Script font designers have always had trouble making each possible letter combination work together while still retaining the handwritten look, and many fonts sacrifice overall letter shape for consistency of ligatures across the alphabet. Lobster Two uses smart ligatures and alternatives to join letters, and so a much more considered and stable script results. Lobster Two also styles its ending glyphs to round off words artistically, and letters in their terminal forms reflect much closer the subtle modifications of hand-drawn typefaces.

                        <p class="postText">
                            We chose Lobster Two because of the balance between the straight stems and curved arcs. The lack of decoration on the heads gives Lobster Two a legibility that most script fonts lack. The deep apertures  and decorative eye in the ‘e’ give the word an even rhythm and the base line is very even, but made interesting by the ‘waves’ formed by the spurs and ligatures. This font represents our design ethos as it is functional in its legibility but beautiful in its form and rhythm.
  
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                         
                    
                        <p class="postText">
                            We chose a sans-serif font for our content. Sans-serif fonts are the most unobtrusive way to deliver large chunks of text to a user. They are easy on the eyes and are ubiquitous to the point of banality. The cultural connotations of sans-serifs such as Helvetica and Arial are exploitable in the design world today, as to opt in to their use is to place oneself in the rat race of modern design, while to opt out is to attempt to assert oneself as a forward thinking designer who is bucking the trend. We chose the middle-ground on this spectrum for our main web and print font. Resisting Helvetica, we have chosen Open Sans, a similar but noticeably distinguishable sans-serif. Open Sans is fuller, taller and arguably more beautiful than the perfect, functional and sometimes harsh lines and curves of Helvetica. To the unaware, our site’s font looks like millions of other online, and our goal in selecting this font is to allow potential clients to imagine how our design ideas can affect their brand, rather than letting our site’s own design run amok with their perceptions and visual connotations.
                        </p>

                            Choosing a minimal layout and minimal font for our site allows the portfolio work to take precedence and, additionally, focuses attention on the logo as the main ambassador for our brand, our ideas and our design philosophy.
